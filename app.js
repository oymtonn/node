// Streams are an asynchronous approach
// The file is read in small pieces, and those pieces are sent to the client bit by bit, 
// without waiting for the whole file to load into memory.

//fileStream is continuously reading the file in chunks.
// Each chunk is emitted as a data event.
// pipe takes each chunk and transfers it to the response stream (res), allowing the client to see the file data as itâ€™s being read.
// The client can start seeing the data immediately, without waiting for the entire file to be read.
